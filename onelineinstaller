To run the `screencapture-nag-remover` script from the GitHub repository in one line, you can use the following command in your Terminal (assuming you have `git` installed and are on macOS):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luckman212/screencapture-nag-remover.git && cd screencapture-nag-remover && chmod +x screencapture-nag-remover.sh && ./screencapture-nag-remover.sh
```

This command:
1. Clones the repository.
2. Changes into the cloned directory.
3. Makes the script executable.
4. Runs the script.

Note: You may need to adjust permissions or run with `sudo` depending on your system configuration, and you should review the script beforehand for safety, as it modifies system files.
